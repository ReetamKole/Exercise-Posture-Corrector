# Welcome to the Posture Corrector project repository! This project applies machine learning and computer vision to analyze and improve exercise form for users performing workouts at home or without supervision. By detecting common posture errors during exercises, the system ensures safer and more effective fitness routines.

## Overview
Project Goal
To develop machine learning models capable of detecting and correcting posture errors in four popular exercises:


## Bicep Curl
## Plank
## Squat
## Push-up
Core Technologies
MediaPipe: For real-time human pose detection.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training neural network models.
Scikit-learn: For classical machine learning methods.
Gradio: For creating an interactive user interface.
Features
Error Detection: Identifies incorrect form for specific exercises using predefined thresholds or trained machine learning models.
Detailed Feedback: Provides insights on form deviations and correction suggestions.
Interactive Interface: A user-friendly web application to analyze video inputs and display feedback.
Customizable Models: The system supports retraining and extension to other exercises.
